We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Say you don't know me, or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight
We got too many runaways eating up the night
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Someone's always playing corporation games
Who cares they're always changing corporation names
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible, write us off the page
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
It's just another Sunday, in a tired old street
Well if you got the toco, oh, then we just lost the beat
Who counts the money underneath the bar
Who writes the wrecking ball in two wild guitars
Don't tell us you need us, 'cause we're just simple fools
Looking for America, coming through your schools
Yeah
Don't you remember (remember)
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll, oh
We built, we built this city
Built this city
Built this city
We built, we built this city
Built this city
Built this city
We built, we built this city
Built this city
Built this city
We built, we built this city
Built this city
Built this city
